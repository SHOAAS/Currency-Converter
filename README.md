# Coding HSG - Currency Converter
**Authors**: Joakim Brunstrøm, Sebastian Hoaas, Nick Albin Elliot Hellström, Douglas Falk
## Description
The goal of this project was to create a program that displays the exchange rate between currencies, performs currency conversions, enables the user to check historical data and if currencies have appreciated or depreciated over a given period, and that gives the user an opportunity to search for currency codes. To summarize, the program is intended to be an all-in-one solution for currency conversions.
